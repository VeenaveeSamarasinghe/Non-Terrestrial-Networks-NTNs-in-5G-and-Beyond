## 📄 Description

This article explores the critical role of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) in enhancing 5G and future telecommunication technologies. It highlights how NTNs—comprising satellites (LEO, MEO, GEO), drones, and high-altitude platforms (HAPS)—extend connectivity to remote and underserved areas, bridging the global digital divide.

The article also discusses NTN applications in IoT, emergency response, maritime and aviation communications, and remote monitoring. It addresses the challenges of integrating NTNs with terrestrial 5G networks, such as latency and spectrum efficiency, while offering a forward-looking perspective toward their role in 6G and beyond.
